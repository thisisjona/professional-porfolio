# professional-porfolio

## Description

A front-end  application that showacases projects built during the UT/Trilogy Bootcamp:

- This landing page will be the source to access all projects built during the cohort?
- This portfolio was created as a professional tool to present myself in the industry.
- Instead of directing a potential employer to individual projects, I can present all of them in one webpage.
- I was able to learn how aesthetic and fucntionality can go hand in hand.
